                    <h3>Files and Directories</h3>
                    <p>
                        The file interface is the fundamental building block of this library. Directories are a special
                        abstract implementation of the file interface. All directories should implement the Directory
                        abstract class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are already a few Directory implementations available, such as local storage, in memory,
                        and NodeJS, as well as others. You can also implement your own by overriding all of the
                        abstract methods.
                    </p>

                    <h3>File Browsers</h3>
                    <p>
                        File browsers are implemented as webcomponents. When ui/browser.js is imported as a module,
                        the a custom element with the tag file-browser is defined. To include a file browser in an
                        HTML document import the ui/browser.js file and add a file-browser custom element to the document.
                        By default the browser have an empty MemoryDirectory instance as it's root directory. To
                        change the root directory add one of the DirectoryElement implementations as a child of
                        the file-browser element.
