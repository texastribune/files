                        To open a folder, double-click on the row. The browser forward and back buttons can also be used to
                        change folders. Alternatively, if you are in a mobile browser where double-click does not work, you
                        can right click on the row to open the &quot;context menu&quot; and select &quot;Open&quot;.

                        If you want to add it do a folder you are not currently in,
                        hold the file over the desired directory for without dropping it. After a few seconds, the folder
                        should open and you can drop the file.

                        If the desired destination is not conveniently accessible via drag and drop, you can click on the files or
                        folder you want to move and open the &quot;Context Menu&quot;. Click on &quot;Move&quot; in the menu. A dialog will
